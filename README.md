# Mikrotik Winbox Password Reader
This program is used to read the passwords database from Winbox for MikroTik.

I created this program because I regularly forgot passwords and logins for the devices I tested. 

I developed this program using version: PHP 8.4

Terminal:

```
php -S 127.0.0.1:9001
```
